# Santander-customer-transaction

**BUISNESS PROBLEM:-**
<br>The problem is posed by Santander group, a financial services company looking for ways to help clients understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals. The transaction made by a customer is purely on oneâ€™s instinct and intuition, here the group is seeking Machine learning solution to help them identify which customer will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. This is all to achieve the overall customer satisfaction.
<br>The historical data related to past activity of the consumer can be used for predictive modeling that captures attributes to which may have great influence on future customer activity. This opens up the way for marketing department to come up with new strategies and optimized marketing campaigns, suited to customer needs which in turn enhances their experience. This significantly reduces the customer attrition rate and increases the customer life time value(LTV).

**DATA SET ANALYSIS:-**
<br>We have two data files- one is for training which contains the binary target column and the other is test data without the target column. Both have 200,000 rows.
The dataset provided has the same structure as the real data available with the organization. The train dataset contains 200 Numeric feature variables and a binary target column. The features are anonymized and this a high dimensional data set. As features are anonymized, it certainly veils our understanding of the data set which is the first step of solving any problem.
<br>This is a binary classification problem. We have to predict weather a customer will make a transaction or not given a set of variables. Here the main challenge is to deal with anonymized data.
